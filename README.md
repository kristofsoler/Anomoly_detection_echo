# Anomaly Detection and visualisation in Echocardiography:  Pathology Identification using convLSTM beta variational autoencoder with one class learning

TThis study investigates the use of a Convolutional LSTM Variational Autoencoder (convLSTM bVAE) for detecting abnormalities in echocardiographic data. The model was trained on a one-class dataset of echo clips with normal heart function and tested on two classes to differentiate between normal and abnormal cardiac motion using reconstruction errors. The methodology combined convolutional layers for spatial feature extraction with LSTM layers for temporal learning, and a beta balanced latent space. The model achieved an accuracy of 81% and an AUC of 0.91, demonstrating its ability to generalize to unseen pathological cases. Reconstruction error visualizations highlighted abnormal regions in the heart. Key limitations included dataset noise and missing patient-specific variables, motivating future improvements in model adaptability. This study demonstrates the potential of convLSTM VAEs for automating anomaly detection in echocardiographic sequences.
